# __literacy__ - interactive literate programming in markdown

> [`...`](http://roxygen.org/knuth-literate-programming.pdf) considering programs to works of literature. `...`  surely nobody wants to admit writing an _illiterate_ program.
> - _Donald Knuth_ - **Literate Programming** 

## Installation


    %%bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/tonyfast/literacy
    
### Activate literacy

    %load_ext literacy


Literacy transforms all code cells to interactive blocks of markdown.  When a cell is executed:
    
1. The code blocks are __tangled__ from the markdown source.
2. The source code is __woven__, sometimes through a __jinja2__ template, then displayed as a markdown object[]

> Cells without code blocks do not increment the input number.



In iteractive literate mode, all inline code cells, like `print('inline')`, and code blocks

    print('block code')
    
are concatenated as python and executed.
    
Compose functions in markdown...
    
    def foo(a): 
        b = 42*a
and add annotations in between lines of code.
        return 42*a


    inline
    block code



## Templating Mode

    %load_ext literacy.template
    
Templating mode passes the markdown source through a `__import__('jinja2').Template` before 
the tangling and weaving steps.  The template has access to variables in `globals;` and the
IPython user namespace. 



### Template Example

#### A question about typography?

Which rendered code is preferable for teaching a new programmer?

##### Python <code>for</code> loops?
    
    for i in range(5): foo(i)
      
##### A block of literal code?

    foo(0)
    foo(1)
    foo(2)
    foo(3)
    foo(4)
    
    
    
#### Template Scope

The code above has access to `foo;` defined previously.  A notebook should restart and run all, 
in template mode all variables used in templates must be defined in a prior cell.  Consider 
`b=False`, `assert ~b` is available to the python scope not the jinja scope.



## [Importing Literate Notebooks](docs/imports.md).

All literacy notebooks including templated notebooks are importable if they are run-all-able.

## Macros

__macros__ hide abstractions.  `import literacy` has a few simples __macros__, or rules.



### Files

Simply place a local filename in a code cell to render it as markdown.

    %%file test.md
    ###### I am going to be __*imported*__


    Overwriting test.md



###### I am going to be __*imported*__



### Urls

Place a url in the code cell to show a webiste as an <code>iframe</code>.



### Escaping Output

Begin a code cell with a blank to suppress output.


    code



#### Motivation

Literate programming with Markdown encourages code blocks to have a single indent.  In IPython 
code cells a new line + a tab returns an `IndentationError`:
    
    try:
        eval("""\n\tprint('üëé')""")
    except IndentationError:
        
while removing the tab is allowed.
    
        eval("""\nprint('üëç')""")
        
        
The blank line opinion makes it more difficult to activate an `IndentationError`.


    üëç



### Escaping Code

All markdown code blocks are executed, but html code blocks can be used to ignore code, or 
use python comments.
